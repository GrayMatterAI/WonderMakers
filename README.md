# 🚀 WonderMakers.ai

Unlocking children's boundless creativity with the power of AI. This project, still in its very early stages, is powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## 🎨 About the Project

At WonderMakers.ai, we envisioned a platform where a simple photograph of a child’s drawing could be transformed into a beautifully rendered cartoon with a meaningful storyline. Parents or children could choose a style and a narrative centered on pivotal life lessons such as ‘empathy,’ ‘sharing,’ ‘resilience,’ ‘family values,’ and the essence of ‘true friendship.’

However, despite our enthusiasm, we found that the technology wasn’t quite there to fully realize our vision. The project is currently in its early stages 🚧, with parts of the front-end made using SvelteKit and Tailwind.css. We believe in the power of collective innovation, so we’ve open-sourced the project, inviting anyone inspired to take it forward.

Developers, educators, and creative minds are invited to build upon our groundwork and inch closer to making this dream a reality!
